# ThreeHaskellFunctions
Wrote 3 functions in functional language Haskell: primeFactorList, encodeCount, and symmetric. 

## primeFactorList
Given a positive integer, this function returns a list of its prime factors. 
## encodeCount
Given a string or list, this function returns a list of tuples, each containing a letter that occured in the string/list and the number of characters it occurs at that point. 
Ex: 
encodeCount "1123" returns [(2,'1'),(1,'2'),(1,'3')]
## symmetric
Given a binary tree, this function returns True/False depending on whether or not it is symmetric.
